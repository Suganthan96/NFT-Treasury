# NFT Treasury Project Documentation

## üí° Inspiration

Inspired by the idea of exclusive access through NFT ownership, I built a Web3 platform that restricts content to users who hold specific NFTs. The vision was to create a decentralized membership system where:

- **Exclusive Access**: Only verified NFT holders can access premium content
- **Blockchain Verification**: Using smart contracts for unhackable authentication
- **Token-Gated Experiences**: Creating secure, community-driven access control
- **Decentralized Authentication**: Moving beyond traditional centralized login systems

The project emerged from recognizing the fundamental problems with centralized membership platforms:
- Single points of failure that can be hacked
- Lack of cryptographic proof of ownership
- Bypassable authentication systems
- No transparent verification process

## üéØ What it does

NFT Treasury is a comprehensive Web3 application that implements a tiered membership system based on NFT ownership:

### Core Functionality:
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection via Rainbow Kit and MetaMask
- **NFT Verification**: Real-time blockchain queries using Alchemy SDK
- **Tiered Access Control**: 
  - ü•â **Bronze Tier** (1-2 NFTs): Access to 12 standard NFTs and basic features
  - ü•à **Silver Tier** (3-4 NFTs): Premium NFTs, Discord access, priority minting
  - ü•á **Gold VIP** (5+ NFTs): Exclusive collections, 30% discounts, analytics dashboard

### Key Features:
- **Token-Gated Content**: Premium galleries, exclusive NFT collections
- **Dynamic Pricing**: VIP discounts for Gold tier members
- **Real-time Benefits**: Instant activation via BitBadges webhooks
- **Multi-layer Security**: Blockchain + BitBadges + Smart Contract verification
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized metadata storage via Pinata
- **Community Features**: Discord integration, VIP events, email notifications

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

### Frontend Architecture:
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern, type-safe UI development
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, utility-first styling
- **Rainbow Kit + Wagmi**: Seamless Web3 wallet integration
- **Custom Hooks**: `useMembershipNFTs` for NFT count tracking

### Backend Infrastructure:
- **Node.js + Express**: RESTful API server
- **Webhook System**: Real-time benefit activation
- **Email Integration**: Nodemailer for member communications
- **IPFS Storage**: Pinata for decentralized file storage

### Blockchain Integration:
- **Alchemy SDK**: Reliable blockchain data queries
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom ERC-721 minting contracts
- **Ethereum Sepolia**: Testnet deployment for development
- **BitBadges API**: Decentralized membership badge system

### Key Technical Components:
```typescript
// NFT Ownership Verification
export async function ownsAnyERC721(address: string): Promise<string[]> {
  const nfts = await alchemy.nft.getNftsForOwner(address);
  const erc721s = nfts.ownedNfts.filter(nft => nft.tokenType === "ERC721");
  return erc721s.map(nft => nft.contract.address);
}

// Membership Tier Logic
const membershipTiers = {
  Bronze: { minNFTs: 1, benefits: ['Website Access', 'Basic Minting'] },
  Silver: { minNFTs: 3, benefits: ['Discord Access', 'Premium NFTs'] },
  Gold: { minNFTs: 5, benefits: ['VIP Perks', '30% Discount', 'Exclusive Collections'] }
};
```
